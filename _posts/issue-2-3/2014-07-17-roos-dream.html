Robert Boyle’s remarkable to-do list for future scientists ranged from “the Art of Flying” to  “Potent Druggs to alter or Exalt Imagination.”
</p>
</div>

<p>
Robert Boyle, the seventeenth-century polymath, chemist, and fellow of the Royal Society, left in his papers a twenty-four-item list of predictions of the future.  Though he discovered the famous law of gaseous pressure and volume that bears his name, Boyle was not just blowing hot air.  The Royal Society was the first government-sponsored scientific society in the world.  As part of a charter granted by King Charles II, the Society charged itself, in that delightfully immodest manner characteristic of the Restoration, to “extend not only the boundaries of the Empire, but also the very arts and sciences.”
</p>

<p>
So, the list Boyle left us was all about boundary breaking, and a successful list it was. Many of the items, such as “the art of flying,”  “the art of continuing long under water, and exercising functions freely there,” and even “Varnishes perfumable by Rubbing” have been achieved in the form of airplanes, scuba diving, and scratch-and-sniff. A <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-25776311">designer even recently created</a> minty scratch-and-sniff jeans, the smell lasting through ten washes.
</p>

<p>
Boyle’s list reminds us that science has always been bound together with novelty and entertainment.  The early Royal Society’s meetings were in fact characterized as “entertainments” for wealthy and interested gentlemen, and Boyle himself demonstrated a trick of writing with a finger dipped into luminescent phosphorus, the “icy noctiluca” as he termed it, making enchanting displays.

<p>
These wish lists of future predictions derived in part from the natural philosophical projects of Francis Bacon (1561-1626), whose scientific method of empirical observation and induction were revered by the Royal Society. As the historian <a href="http://honors.uoregon.edu/faculty/vera-keller">Vera Keller</a> has demonstrated, invention—whether ancient, modern, or not-yet-discovered—was a major preoccupation of early modern thinkers.  Bacon, in particular, formulated the idea of the <em>desiderata</em> or wish list, or inventions that were seen as particularly desirable. Keller <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/669047">writes</a> that these lists served as “markers for what humankind might achieve together… serving to expand the horizon of possibility.” Some of his motivation for making such lists was purely political, economic and practical, as Bacon called them, “experiments of fruit,” whereas other investigations were to advance knowledge, or for “experiments of light.”  Wish lists appeared as part of political projects before they appeared as scientific projects; desiderata about improvements in navigation, for example, were written with the aim of extending England’s empire.
</p>

<!-- 6 -->
<p>
By surpassing the bounds of empire, nature, and knowledge via experimentation, Bacon argued that humankind could restore itself to its perfect pre-lapsarian state before the fall in the Garden of Eden. Humans could use knowledge of the natural world to have dominion over nature, not just for material benefit but also for charitable purposes, to improve “man’s estate.”  Because of this important aim, Bacon also argued that it was a crucial job of the historian to keep old technologies from being lost to the mists of time, as well as to open up new lines of future enquiry.
</p>

<!-- 7 -->
<p>
As an historian of science, I thought I’d follow Bacon’s advice about listing and writing about past and future inventions. I decided to see what the contemporary Royal Society thought about its visions for the future. My first point of call was the <a href="http://blogs.royalsociety.org/in-verba/">Society’s blog of advice</a> to science policy makers.  Much of the advice is dedicated to inventing technologies not only to control nature as Bacon advised, but also to mitigate the effects of human intervention on the planet. Reducing sources or enhancing the sinks of greenhouse gases, promoting sustainable development, and using science to reduce the impact of natural disasters are common themes, but so is geo-engineering, or as the blog describes, a “suite of techniques to reduce global warming by intervening in the Earth’s climate system. It can involve removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, or reflecting a small proportion of sunlight back into space.” Bacon himself in <em>The New Atlantis</em> envisioned a mysterious island nation whose citizens had “great and spacious houses, where we imitate and demonstrate meteors—as snow, hail, rain, some artificial rains of bodies and not of water, thunders, lightnings.” Scientists have always dreamed of controlling the weather.
</p>

<p>
The Society’s blog is entitled <em>In Verba</em>, a rather geeky pun on its motto <em>Nullius in verba</em> (Take nobody’s word for it, find out for yourself). I therefore decided to ask a few Fellows of the Royal Society this question: If you were making a 21st century wish list of scientific discoveries or future innovations, what would you include?

<strong>To understand how and why the brain generates sleep.</strong><br />We spend approximately 36% of our lives asleep. This makes sleep the single most important behaviour we experience yet as individuals and as a society we disregard it. We already know that sleep is not the simple suspension of activity but a state that is associated with critical brain functions such as memory consolidation and information processing, whilst in the rest of the body tissue repair, toxin clearance and the rebuilding of energy reserves all occur during sleep. We also know that disrupted sleep is associated with multiple health problems including cognitive impairment, impulsive behaviur, mental illness, metabolic abnormalities including diabetes II, immune suppression, increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular problems and ultimately death. Our waking experience and health depends upon “good sleep”, but what is good sleep; how does the brain generate sleep; why is our health so dependent upon sleep; and could we develop drugs to fully mimic sleep?
