<p>
Lazarus Colloredo of Genoa<br />
had a conjoined twin,<br />
<em>Monstrum novissimum</em>,<br />
a human Janus<br />
hidden under his cloak,<br />
whose torso, head and left leg<br />
dangled from the belly
</p>

<p>
of the mobile Lazarus.<br />
The sins of the mother,<br />
seventeenth century belief—<br />
parasitic hydrocephalic, flesh<br />
and blood doppelgänger.<br />
The twin never opened his eyes,<br />
or closed his drooling halitosis.
</p>

<p>
Lazarus married, had children.<br />
By all accounts, his wife<br />
was happy, learned to love him.<br />
Audiences paid to see and pinch<br />
the twin, Joannes Baptista,<br />
to hear him peep.<br />
Showing made them rich.

<p>
They visited Paris,<br />
the court of Charles the First.<br />
In a bar, Lazarus killed<br />
a teasing man, was reprieved<br />
to save his innocent brother,<br />
the echo, the contained<br />
monster-twin of every man.
