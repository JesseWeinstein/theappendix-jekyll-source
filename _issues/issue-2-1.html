blurb: >
  Digging may seem like the simple act of moving dirt, but it has deep resonances. Digs can be homes or insults; we can dig in the dirt or in archives. We hope our excavations of the word are entertaining and edifying, but above all that they inspire you, our reader, to go digging yourself.
