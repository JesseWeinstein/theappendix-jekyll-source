It is not that I do not believe<br />
in mystery.  Just this morning I sat<br />
blank and primitive under diurnal<br />
shade, all recessive, nameless<br />
the soft warming friction, dark on light.<br />
Something untouchable blows overhead:<br />
cloud of leaf imprintable;<br />
the head is sensible to its effects.
</p>

<p>
It is that instead I believed<br />
all uncompleted possibilities sealed;<br />
we know all we would know<br />
in time—the final stone had been thrown<br />
into the final cave, the final ancient scrolls<br />
procured, all that remained, translation.  Having flown<br />
in the sun longer than the sphinx,<br />
we knew all we would not know,<br />
wise to being none the wiser, never.

<p>
So when they found personal effects—<br />
freckle removal cream (her natural weakness;<br />
no one knew upon her vanishing<br />
she still anointed herself with vanishing)<br />
a woman’s shoe, the tobacco her navigator<br />
preferred—the difficult article of faith was not<br />
<em>Amelia is found</em> but <em>Amelia, so long<br />
visible, just now has been found</em>
</p>

What does such an article mean<br />
for the man of panoptic faith—the man<br />
of global positioning, astrology finally turned over,<br />
the sky’s chart of the earth compasses-marked,<br />
fashioned with planes and satellites<br />
and silicon seerstones; the man of commissioned<br />
soldiers looking grainy-green through night vision<br />
goggles into the desert for enemies of his state;<br />
the man of all healings’ eventuality, looking grainy-green<br />
at the golden tablature of toxicology reports,<br />
at men as Christmas trees walking; the man of wide,<br />
ballistic, compassionate precision; the man<br />
of universal application, the phrenological sweep<br />
of his finger across his handheld screen,<br />
divining his world no bigger than a hazelnut?<br />
<em>Is not this thing in my right hand</em>

All that can be seen has been should<br />
be seen.  Saint Anthony lies dead<br />
on some island—doesn’t he?  Pray

tell, Amelia: How long after the crash<br />
must a grounded flying woman hold<br />
her personal effects before the sun<br />
or lesser searchlights bleach articles<br />
to artifacts to facts to nothing? Why<br />
has this your atlas been so difficult<br />
for searching men in searchable times?<br />
Why have men searched for you,<br />
the lost lady adventurer, like a city<br />
of gold from whom the blemishes<br />
like darkened pixels have vanished?  Whose pacific<br />
tide fogs your landing strip? Whose the right<br />
of way? What kind of faith is yours,<br />
blessed Saint Amelia, your pacific<br />
elusion of god knows<br />
how many flyovers since yours<br />
the most visible vanishing—yours the lesson<br />
in instrumental failure, yours the call<br />
to the man of panoptic faith<br />
to consider new articles and become<br />
newly sensible to the inconclusive?
