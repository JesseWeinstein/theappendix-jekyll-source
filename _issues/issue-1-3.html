blurb: >
  Though the dead leave material traces in the frozen faces of statues, in the words in books, or the ghostly voices on LPs, perhaps the act of recording failed to capture something fundamental about their souls. We can never hear their voice. Or can we? “Out Loud” explores many answers to this question. Not all of the pieces in this issue harmonize, but there’s as much to learn in cacophony as in melody.
