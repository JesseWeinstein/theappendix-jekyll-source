“This is how selves work; they hover / over their border,” writes Molly Brodak. So too do these three elegant, austere, vivid poems hover between past and present.

We at <em>The Appendix</em> were intrigued by Brodak’s <a href="http://www.guernicamag.com/poetry/phoenix/">oblique poem about the discoverer of microscopy</a> for <em>Guernica</em>, and asked her if she had any other works that might tie in with our “Digs” theme. She wrote back with three poems that brilliantly evoke the past as foreign country. Each of these poems is concerned with a kind of burial—the death of a geologist, the artifacts left by “the people before,” the “romance of bones” at a saint’s tomb. Yet they also hinge on transformations. “Spikes of stars and blank ribbons waving from mouths / across the Apocalypse Tapestry” find new life “as floor mats, horse blankets, frost wrap / for the orange trees,” and “girls’ gold-locked skull parts” are patched with replacements from “mastiffs / and old men.”
