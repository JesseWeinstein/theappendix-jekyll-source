Welcome to our new *Magic Lantern* series, where we spotlight a singular image that we think deserves wider exposure.  When magic lanterns were first invented in sixteenth-century Italy, illusionists used them to conjure spectral images of demons and ghosts before astonished audiences. Even as technology’s ability to replicate images has became the stuff of everyday life, a vivid picture retains an evocative power that words seldom equal. But [images mean little without context](http://theappendix.net/blog/2012/11/cabinets-of-curiosity:-the-web-as-wunderkammer), so we’ll do our best to share our findings about the background and provenance of these weekly images as well.

Our first installment is a print by an anonymous Japanese artist from the 1870s. Remarkably, it depicts the famous naturalist John James Audubon. And even more remarkably, it shows Audubon looking forlornly at a fleeing rat:

Audubon, it turns out, was a [crossover hit](http://tumblr.theappendix.net/post/46518997242/famed-naturalist-and-painter-john-james-audubon) with the nature-loving public of Meiji Japan. He became so popular that an anecdote involving the destruction of his sketches of “nearly a thousand inhabitants of the air” by Norwegian rats was memorialized in this striking woodblock print.
