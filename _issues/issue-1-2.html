year: 2013
blurb: >
  In creating and tracing illusions, we risk being caught ourselves. Historians once limited themselves to determining which source was more trustworthy; which fact more true. Today we're more open to the possibility that archives lie, that insights can be gained from these lies, and that what we seek in our investigations changes us—and sometimes even the historical record itself.
