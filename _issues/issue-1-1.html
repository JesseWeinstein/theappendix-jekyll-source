blurb: >
  _The Appendix_ sprang from a simple idea: a lot of what makes the past fascinating, human, and relevant ends up on history’s cutting room floor. It has been said, after all, that only around one-tenth of historians’ research makes it into their published work. A tenth of newspapers read, books carried, archives explored, receipts tallied, journals skimmed, letters digested. A tenth of people’s lives sifted to make history manageable and ready for publication. _The Appendix_ provides a home for the other nine-tenths.
