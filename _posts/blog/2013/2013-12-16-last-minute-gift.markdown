Dear readers of *The Appendix*,

It’s been a big first year for us, and we appreciate your support for our project of creating a venue for rigorous, experimental, and engaging history online. We’re looking forward to publishing our first anniversary issue this January and are thankful you’re here to celebrate that milestone with us.

At the moment, though, we’re in the middle of the holiday gift-giving season, and we’ve just made [gift subscriptions available](http://shop.theappendix.net/collections/gift-certificates/products/1-year-gift-subscription) in our online shop. For $24, you can give your friends and family a year of new issues of the *The Appendix* and access to our back catalog of downloadable ebook and PDF versions of issues.

For those of you who already subscribe, thank you. Sharing *The Appendix* with others is the best way to help us continue to bring our readers innovative new methods in how to write and share the past. For those of you who don’t subscribe yet, if you [sign up for a $2/month subscription](https://theappendix.net/subscribe) this week, we’ll send you a **free gift subscription** to give to a friend.

Digital media make great last minute gifts. If you buy a gift or sign up for a new subscription before midnight PST on December 23, we guarantee you’ll have your gifts in your email before the 25th.

When you buy, we will send you a unique gift code that the recipient can redeem by clicking a link from an email or typing a short URL in their web browser. We’ll send you a PDF you can print out and stick in an envelope or attach to an email, but you can also simply share the special URL by email or in a personalized card, however you like.

Thanks for supporting and sharing *The Appendix*. We hope you enjoy the holidays.

Best wishes from your Appendix co-founders,

Ben, Brian, Chris, and Felipe
