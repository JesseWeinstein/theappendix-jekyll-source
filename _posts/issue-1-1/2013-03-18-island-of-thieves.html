<p class="editorial-intro">
For this first original installment of the Not-So-Funny Pages of <em>The Appendix</em> Andrew illustrated an epic moment from <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Travels_of_Mendes_Pinto.html?id=PRqGfeAwryIC"><em>The Travels of Fernão Mendes Pinto</em></a> (1614), a posthumously-published travelogue by a Portuguese merchant, Fernão Mendes Pinto, who sailed throughout the Indian Ocean and South China Sea in the sixteenth century, surviving a series of misfortunes. This was one of them.
